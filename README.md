## App Description
Managing money shouldn't feel like a spreadsheet. **FOLIA** transforms personal finance into a highly visual, intuitive experience. Built with a stunning dark-mode aesthetic, glowing glassmorphic accents, and buttery-smooth animations, the app gives users instant clarity on their spending habits and shared expenses.

Whether you are scanning a receipt from lunch, checking how close you are to your monthly grocery limit, or generating a beautiful watermarked image to remind a friend they owe you for dinner, FOLIA handles the math effortlessly. Because everything is stored securely on your local device via SQLite, your financial data remains completely private.
